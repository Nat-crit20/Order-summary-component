## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

With this project I learned more about how to read documentation, strengthed my flex box skills, and add hover elements. I also learned about media queries and adding background images. It is also at this point that I am starting to better understand positioning in css.

### Continued development

I would like to continue to devolope my documentaion reading as well as try to continue to better understand flex box and positioning.
